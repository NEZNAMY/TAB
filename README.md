# About
TAB aims to be a superior all-in-one minecraft plugin for displaying information that outperforms all 
similar plugins in terms of features, performance, compatibility and support.  
More information can be found at [Why TAB?](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/wiki/Why-TAB%3F) wiki page.

# Distribution
As of TAB 3.0.0, released with MC 1.18 (November 30th, 2021), there is no free / premium
version anymore. Only one version of the plugin exists now, which contains all implemented features
and is available to everyone for free. However, official support on discord is only provided to 
those who have purchased the plugin.  

# Compiling
Compilation requires JDK 8 and up.  
To compile the plugin, run `./gradlew build` from the terminal.  
Once the plugin compiles, grab the jar from `/jar/build/libs/` folder.

# Issues
The [Issues](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/issues) section is **only** available for cases included in templates.
In other words, they **are not available for**:  
* **Support** - support is provided on discord for buyers, where roles are given to verified users
allowing us to know who bought it and who didn't. It also serves as a much faster way of communication.
* **Feature requests** - closed indefinitely.

# Contributing
If this plugin has helped you in any way, and you would like to return something back 
to make the plugin even better, there is a lot of ways to contribute:  
* Open a **pull request** containing a new feature or a bug fix, which you believe many users will benefit from.
* Make detailed high-quality **bug reports**. The difference between a bug getting fixed in 1 week vs 1 hour 
is in quality of the report (typically providing correct steps to reproduce that actually work).
* Test **experimental builds**, which can be found in [Github Actions](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/actions) or in a form of pre-releases on discord
for problems of any kind including bugs. This way you will help make the actual releases more stable / help get stable releases sooner.
* Help improve the wiki by opening a [Wiki change issue](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Wiki&template=wiki_change.yml), 
where you can improve existing descriptions, add information you found missing, fix typos / grammar mistakes or add more examples of usage of functions.
* [Buy a copy](https://www.mc-market.org/resources/14009/) of the plugin or [send a donation](https://paypal.me/neznamy1) to keep the plugin active.
