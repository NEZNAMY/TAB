# About
This folder contains the plugin's description as advertised on various marketplaces where each one uses a different syntax.
(BBCode, Markdown).  
  
While this is not an accurate folder to have this stored in (`.github`),
it is the closest if we don't want to create a folder for this in the root.  
  
The file structure of this folder is as following:  

| File name               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| images                  | Folder containing all images used in the descriptions and wiki for advertising. Used not only as a backup, but for hosting them as well, so we do not need to rely on third party websites. |

| description_bbcode.txt  | Plugin description written in **bbcode** syntax. Used by **SpigotMC** and **BuiltByBit**.                                                                                                   |
