If this plugin has helped you in any way, and you would like to return something back 
to make the plugin even better, there is a lot of ways to contribute:  
* Open a **pull request** containing a new feature or a bug fix, which you believe many users will benefit from.
* Make detailed high-quality **bug reports**. The difference between a bug getting fixed in 1 week vs 1 hour 
is in quality of the report (typically providing correct steps to reproduce that actually work).
* Test **experimental builds**, which can be found in [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/actions) for problems of any kind including bugs. 
This way you will help make the actual releases more stable / help get stable releases sooner.
* Help improve the wiki by opening a [Wiki change issue](https://github.com/NEZNAMY/TAB/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Wiki&template=wiki_change.yml), 
where you can improve existing descriptions, add information you found missing, fix typos / grammar mistakes or add more examples of usage of functions.
* [Buy a copy](https://builtbybit.com/resources/14009/) of the plugin or [send a donation](https://paypal.me/neznamy1) to keep the plugin active.
